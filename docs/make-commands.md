## Make commands for docker


### Start the entire DEV environment:

Before run pip install -r requirements.dev.txt, run "sudo apt-get install libpq-dev" on Debian/Ubuntu.

```
make install
```

The first installation of machines in the DEV environment takes a while, but after that the waiting time is greatly reduced.
